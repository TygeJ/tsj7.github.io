      Thank you for checking out my work. If you would like to connect I can be reached at tygesjohnson@gmail.com. My purpose in writing software is to use technology to solve problems. <br> <br>Throughout my career I have worked in the supply chain management, ecommerce, and medical industries. Each position in each different industry constantly reminded me of how important technology, data & analytics, and automation are.<br><br>
       These reminders are what pushed me into the software development industry. What has kept me here is my passion to continue learning everyday, I find satisfaction in solving complex issues and enjoy the challenges and opportunities they afford.
